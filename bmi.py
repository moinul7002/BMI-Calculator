# Baseball player's Height, Weight and BMI Calculation

# Dataset: http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_Data_MLB_HeightsWeights

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array from height_in: np_height_in
np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Print out np_height_in
print(np_height_in)

# Convert np_height_in to m: np_height_m
np_height_m = np_height_in * 0.0254

# Print np_height_m
print(np_height_m)

# Create array from weight_lb with metric units: np_weight_kg
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight_lb) * 0.453592

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Print out bmi
print(bmi)

# Lightweight baseball players
# Create the light array
light = bmi < 21
